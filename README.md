# { "document": "How to run the project" }

Hey! We are excited that you are interested in joining the team at Regov Technologies.

We feel that the best place to really show us your skills is somewhere you feel comfortable. This test should not take you a long amount of time to complete.

This take home test is used to determine how you go about solving problems logically, as well as building out easy to use, performant user interfaces. This test is very open to interpretation and implementation.

### How to run

Simply install Docker and Compose on your machine before you start running this project.

1. `cd` into the directory `/`
2. run `docker-compose up --build` and see the logs to see how the code is built and deployed.
3. side note: if your Machine is docker-heavy run this `docker system prune --all` which will clear everything but will also delete all containers so be careful.

### Those were the User Stories (Requirements)

- As a user I can register on the app.
- As a user I can upload my international passport or identity card.
- As a user I can preview my inputs and edit on the same page before submitting my registration.
- As a user I can view the App on Mobile, Tablet or laptop. (responsiveness)
- As a user I can login to view my registration submission.
- As a user I can log in and logout.
- As a user I can edit submitted information anytime.

Feel free to go above and beyond if you have ideas for extra features!

### Those were the Notes and recommendations

- Frontend : ReactJS with TypeScript
- Backend : Node.js with TypeScript
- Dockerize your app.
- This is an API based application.
- The project structure is up to your decision.
- You are recommended to use git commits in a logical manner to demonstrate the development progress.
- Writing tests and adhering to development standards/conventions will attract extra points.
- Writing design documents will attract extra points :)

### Thank you for your time to review
